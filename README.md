# Prima #
An Open-Source, Multithreaded, Highly flexible Java based Generative art library

# Discord server! #

We have a discord server where you can get help with / otherwise discuss the library. The link is here: discord.gg/s76zUPR

We hope to see you there!

# Not a complete readme yet! #

I am a busy person with a lot of stuff to do, but put shortly this project has a lot to it, and at this very moment I don't have the time to write an extremely detailed readme about it. So stay tuned if you're interested, i've got a video about it coming out soon which should show a bit about how to use it, as well as later how it works under the hood. feel free to explore the source!
